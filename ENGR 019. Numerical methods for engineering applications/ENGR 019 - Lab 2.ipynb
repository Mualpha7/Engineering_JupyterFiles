I was not able to find a way to solve for the voltages and currents without having the resistances in the input. Ohm's Law says that the resistance is equal to the quotient of the voltage drop through the component and the current through it, but since we are trying to find both the voltages and the currents, we can't also have the resistances as unknowns since it is not possible to derive them from other equations either. Also, without this extra input in the function, we are not really using the resistances given to us in Circuits 1, 2, and 3.\n",

An example where our code would fail would be if we had multiple resistors in one edge, as in the modification of Circuit 3 that we have above (say R4 is 40 ohms). This is because the size of matrix $C$ does not coincide with the number of edges in the circuit, because there is an edge with more than one resistor. This is an easy case to fix by adding a few lines of codes to add up resistors in series so we end up with only one resistor at most per edge."
